## Contributing
 Contributions are welcome. Suggested workflow:

## Fork the repo.
Add a new pattern file in patterns.

Ensure the file reads input(s) from stdin and prints the pattern to stdout.

Add example input/output in an examples/ file or the top of the .cpp as a comment.

Open a pull request with a short description of the pattern and sample output.
